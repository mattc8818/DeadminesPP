# DeadminesPP

This repository is where my project DeadminesPP will rest. DeadminesPP is a project based around an open source game I found here on Github by Misttgun, simply called Text RPG. 

I will be working with his code, expanding it, and learning from it, as I learn the workflow and development style of C++.

As of 8/15/2019, the current code is still unrevised and all his, but I will soon upload my planned revisions.

# Text RPG

Source code for my C++ Text-based RPG style game.

I built this repository to learn and practice my C++ skills. I will try to add as much features as I can.

Use cmake to built the repository. If you use Visual Studio, you will need to copy the assets and data directory to the executable folder.

I did not test the project build on Mac. Maybe you will need to change the CMakeLists file accordingly.

Last but not least, this project uses JSON for Modern C++. The file is already inside the project so you don't need to download it.
